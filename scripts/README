ZeroGrid XFCE dedicated desktop (for remote usage)
Written by Ugljesa Lukesevic. All rights reserved.

This folder is reserved for internal system usage, since it's contents are used on this machine startup!
Changing (deleting/modifying/renaming) can cause system loss (and probably not starting the machine/container).

Help is by default added as a shortcut on the desktop, and in application menu.
You can find direct page here, in "help" directory.

Note: you can run script "dotdesktop_trust.sh" if you want to mass trust desktop executables (since it isn't already).
